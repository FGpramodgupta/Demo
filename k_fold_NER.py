Yes, you can **perform cross-validation (CV) using spaCy‚Äôs transformer-based models** (like `en_core_web_trf`) ‚Äî but it's **more resource-intensive** and requires some adjustments compared to CV with spaCy‚Äôs blank or small models.

---

### ‚úÖ **What is a transformer (trf) model in spaCy?**

Transformer models in spaCy (like `en_core_web_trf`) are built on top of Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and provide **state-of-the-art** performance for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER).

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How to Perform Cross-Validation with `en_core_web_trf`**

1. **Install Requirements**
   Make sure you have:

```bash
pip install spacy[transformers]
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf
```

2. **Prepare Your Training Data**
   Format should be:

```python
TRAIN_DATA = [
    ("John Smith invested in Apple Inc.", {"entities": [(0, 10, "CLIENT"), (24, 34, "ASSET")]}),
    ...
]
```

3. **Cross-Validation Setup Using `KFold` from scikit-learn**

Here‚Äôs a **simplified outline** of cross-validation with a transformer model:

---

### üí° Example: Cross-Validation with Transformer Model

```python
import spacy
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from spacy.training.example import Example
from spacy.util import minibatch
import random

# Load transformer pipeline
nlp_base = spacy.load("en_core_web_trf")

# Sample annotated data
TRAIN_DATA = [
    ("John Smith invested in Apple Inc.", {"entities": [(0, 10, "CLIENT"), (24, 34, "ASSET")]}),
    ("Ravi Kumar holds shares of Infosys.", {"entities": [(0, 10, "CLIENT"), (27, 34, "ASSET")]}),
    # Add at least 100‚Äì200 samples for real training
]

# 5-Fold Cross Validation
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Function to train and evaluate on each fold
def train_trf_model(train_data, dev_data, fold_num):
    # Create a fresh copy of the transformer model
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_trf")

    # Get the NER pipe
    ner = nlp.get_pipe("ner")

    # Add new entity labels
    for _, annotations in train_data:
        for start, end, label in annotations["entities"]:
            ner.add_label(label)

    # Disable other components
    other_pipes = [pipe for pipe in nlp.pipe_names if pipe != "ner"]
    with nlp.disable_pipes(*other_pipes), nlp.select_pipes(enable="ner"):
        optimizer = nlp.resume_training()
        for epoch in range(5):  # adjust as needed
            random.shuffle(train_data)
            losses = {}
            batches = minibatch(train_data, size=8)
            for batch in batches:
                examples = []
                for text, annotations in batch:
                    doc = nlp.make_doc(text)
                    example = Example.from_dict(doc, annotations)
                    examples.append(example)
                nlp.update(examples, drop=0.3, losses=losses)
            print(f"Fold {fold_num}, Epoch {epoch+1}, Losses: {losses}")

    # Evaluate on dev_data
    examples = [Example.from_dict(nlp.make_doc(text), annotations) for text, annotations in dev_data]
    scores = nlp.evaluate(examples)
    print(f"Fold {fold_num} Scores: {scores['ents_p']:.2f}, {scores['ents_r']:.2f}, {scores['ents_f']:.2f}")
    return scores

# Run CV
fold = 1
all_scores = []
for train_idx, test_idx in kf.split(TRAIN_DATA):
    train_data = [TRAIN_DATA[i] for i in train_idx]
    test_data = [TRAIN_DATA[i] for i in test_idx]
    score = train_trf_model(train_data, test_data, fold)
    all_scores.append(score)
    fold += 1

# Average F1 across folds
avg_f1 = sum([score["ents_f"] for score in all_scores]) / len(all_scores)
print(f"\nAverage F1-score across folds: {avg_f1:.2f}")
```

### üìå Notes:

* `en_core_web_trf` loads a **transformer-backed NER pipeline**.
* We disable other pipeline components during training to focus on `ner`.
* Cross-validation is done manually using `KFold`.

---

### üìä Output Example:

```
Fold 1, Epoch 1, Losses: {'ner': 7.32}
Fold 1, Epoch 2, Losses: {'ner': 2.10}
Fold 1 Scores: 0.91, 0.85, 0.88
...
Average F1-score across folds: 0.89
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Keep in Mind:

* **Training with `en_core_web_trf` is slow**, especially with larger datasets or on CPU.
* Use **GPU** for faster training: `pip install cupy` and ensure CUDA is available.
* For large-scale tasks, save and load models per fold for reuse or deployment.

Would you like me to package this into a reusable notebook or script for you to run?
