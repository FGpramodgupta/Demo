Yes, exactly — you're on the right track. Let me walk you through a **concrete example**:

---

## 🧩 Scenario:

You have:

* A **DuckDuckGo Search API** (external tool).
* An **MCP Server** (handles tool call and formats context).
* An **MCP Client** (e.g., an LLM or agent that sends/receives messages using MCP).

---

### ✅ **Goal**:

Let a user ask a question like *“Who is the CEO of Microsoft?”*
→ The MCP Client sends it to the MCP Server
→ The MCP Server calls DuckDuckGo
→ Formats the response in **MCP standard format**
→ Returns it to the Client (maybe passed to an LLM for final summarization)

---

## 🧱 Components

### 🧑‍💻 User Prompt:

```
"Who is the CEO of Microsoft?"
```

---

### 📬 1. MCP Client sends the query to MCP Server:

```json
{
  "type": "user_message",
  "content": "Who is the CEO of Microsoft?",
  "role": "user"
}
```

---

### ⚙️ 2. MCP Server processes this:

* Recognizes the need to use a **search tool**
* Calls the **DuckDuckGo API** with the query
* Gets back a search result like:

  > "Satya Nadella is the CEO of Microsoft."

---

### 📦 3. MCP Server packages it in **MCP Tool Response format**:

```json
{
  "type": "tool_response",
  "tool_name": "duckduckgo_search",
  "tool_input": {
    "query": "Who is the CEO of Microsoft?"
  },
  "tool_output": {
    "result": "Satya Nadella is the CEO of Microsoft."
  }
}
```

---

### 🧠 4. MCP Server (optionally) sends this to an LLM:

```json
{
  "type": "assistant_message",
  "content": "According to DuckDuckGo, Satya Nadella is the CEO of Microsoft."
}
```

---

### 📤 5. MCP Client receives the response:

It can show this to the user or pass it along in a multi-turn conversation.

---

## 🔁 Summary of Flow:

```
User → MCP Client → MCP Server → DuckDuckGo API → MCP Server → MCP Client → User
```

With:

* Structured input/output at every step
* Context-aware processing
* MCP-compliant JSON messages

---

Would you like a Python-style code example showing how this MCP server flow might be implemented?
