Automation Plan for ADC Portal Configuration

Background – Current ADC Setup

At present, business partners manually configure navigation steps in the Automated Document Capture (ADC) system to interact with fund portals. These steps are specific to each portal and include:

Navigating to a portal URL (e.g., google.com)
Entering login credentials (username and password)
Clicking login/submit
Traversing through dropdowns, date pickers, and filters
Downloading required documents
Saving them in a predefined temporary shared path

This setup requires the business team to manually inspect and configure element identifiers (IDs, class names, XPaths, etc.) for each step. On average, this process takes 3–4 days per portal.



Problem Statement

The manual setup process for each portal is:

Time-consuming (3–4 days per portal)
Dependent on technical expertise to inspect and hardcode DOM elements
Error-prone and difficult to maintain when portals update UI/UX



Use case 1: Accelerated Onboarding via Automation

Objective:
Reduce portal onboarding time from days to hours by automating the step configuration process.

Approach:

Use browser automation tools with intelligent DOM parsers
Automatically identify fields like username, password, and submit buttons using semantic matching and ML models
Capture click-flows and form submissions in real-time during a guided session or user demonstration
Store the automatically generated sequence as a reusable workflow





Use case 2: Prompt-Based Step Interpretation Using LLM Agent

Objective:
Enable non-technical users to onboard new portals by describing steps in simple English, without needing to inspect DOM elements.

Approach:

Create a Prompt-to-Automation Agent powered by an LLM 
Business users describe the portal interaction in natural language, e.g.:

“Go to portal X, enter login credentials, select year as 2024 from dropdown, download the latest monthly report”
The agent interprets the instructions, maps them to actionable automation steps, and dynamically detects the required DOM elements
