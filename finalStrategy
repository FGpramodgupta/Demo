### **Deployment Strategies Comparison**  

| **Factor**                          | **Strategy 1** <br> JEDi (On-Prem Windows) <br> Business Calc (Azure App Service) | **Strategy 2** <br> JEDi (Azure App Service) <br> Business Calc (Azure App Service) | **Strategy 3** <br> JEDi (On-Prem Windows) <br> Business Calc (Azure Kubernetes Service) | **Strategy 4** <br> JEDi (On-Prem Windows) <br> Business Calc (On-Prem PCF) |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**                      | ‚ùå Limited scalability for JEDi, App Service scales well for Business Calc | ‚úÖ Fully scalable with Azure Auto-Scaling | ‚úÖ Business Calc scales well in AKS, JEDi is limited on-prem | ‚ùå No auto-scaling, PCF is limited by on-prem infrastructure |
| **Performance**                      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential latency between on-prem JEDi & cloud Business Calc | ‚úÖ Optimized performance with both services in the cloud | ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible latency between on-prem JEDi & AKS | ‚ùå On-prem limitations may impact performance |
| **Security & Compliance**             | ‚úÖ JEDi on-prem ensures control; Azure App Service has strong security features | ‚úÖ Azure provides enterprise-grade security & compliance | ‚úÖ AKS ensures security; JEDi on-prem maintains data control | ‚úÖ On-prem ensures full control, but security updates are manual |
| **Maintenance Effort**                | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires manual maintenance for on-prem JEDi, App Service is managed | ‚úÖ Fully managed by Azure, minimal maintenance required | ‚ö†Ô∏è AKS requires Kubernetes expertise; JEDi needs on-prem management | ‚ùå High effort for maintaining both on-prem components |
| **Deployment Complexity**             | ‚ö†Ô∏è Hybrid model requires secure integration between on-prem & Azure | ‚úÖ Simplest deployment with everything in Azure | ‚ö†Ô∏è AKS adds complexity; JEDi remains manually managed | ‚ùå High complexity in managing both JEDi & Business Calc on-prem |
| **Cost Efficiency**                   | ‚ö†Ô∏è On-prem JEDi is cost-effective, but App Service costs increase with usage | ‚ùå Fully cloud-based; higher cost for computing & storage | ‚ö†Ô∏è AKS may be expensive depending on workloads | ‚úÖ On-prem reduces cloud costs but increases infrastructure maintenance costs |
| **Reliability & High Availability**   | ‚ö†Ô∏è JEDi on-prem has a single point of failure; App Service is highly available | ‚úÖ Azure ensures high availability & redundancy | ‚úÖ AKS provides high availability; JEDi on-prem is a single point of failure | ‚ùå No built-in redundancy; risk of outages |
| **Communication Between Services**    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Kafka-based integration between on-prem JEDi & Azure Business Calc | ‚úÖ API-based integration within Azure simplifies communication | ‚ö†Ô∏è Kafka used for on-prem to AKS communication, may introduce delays | ‚ö†Ô∏è Kafka used for on-prem to on-prem communication, but no cloud flexibility |
| **Ease of Future Expansion**          | ‚ö†Ô∏è JEDi might become a bottleneck if business scales | ‚úÖ Easier to expand cloud infrastructure in Azure | ‚úÖ AKS allows container-based scaling, but JEDi is limited | ‚ùå Difficult to scale both on-prem JEDi & PCF |

### **Key Takeaways**  

- **Best for Scalability & Performance:** **Strategy 2 (Fully Cloud - Azure App Service)**  
- **Best for Security & Compliance:** **Strategy 4 (Fully On-Prem - JEDi on Windows Server, Business Calc on PCF)**  
- **Best for Hybrid Flexibility:** **Strategy 3 (JEDi On-Prem, Business Calc on AKS)**  
- **Best for Cost Efficiency (Short Term):** **Strategy 4 (Fully On-Prem)**  
- **Best for Future Growth & Modernization:** **Strategy 2 or Strategy 3**
